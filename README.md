## Do you get value from Magic Preview? I'd love your support!

Hey! It's me, Sven. Magic Preview and my other plug-ins are passion projects released to the world for free. That said, donations are always welcome if you get value from my work.

[üí∏ Donate $10](https://dahlstrand.net/donate/) or any amount you're comfortable with. Thanks! üôè

## Bells and whistles

* üîç Live previews!
* üíæ Auto-save (come back later)
* üìÆ Publish (via the official Micro.blog app)

## Get started

Hello, fellow microblogger! üëã This plug-in is available in the official directory. It's easy to install, but be aware that it's early in development. So bugs and weird things will happen. üòÖ

### Install the plug-in

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Read this before installing!!1!
>
> Magic Preview adds a special post to your blog's archive. It's needed for the preview functionality to work as intended. The post:
>
> * lives here: `https://your-blog.example.com/magic/preview/`
> * shows as the first post in your archive (published 1969)
> * is included in your RSS feed (if you have less than 25 posts)
> * appears on your Micro.blog timeline (if you have less than 25 posts)
>
> If you don't like the above: don't install this plug-in on your main blog. Use [your free test blog](https://www.manton.org/2019/09/04/microblog-test-blogs.html) instead.

1. Find [Magic Preview in the plug-in directory](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/89).
2. Choose the site you want to install the plug-in to.
3. Press *Install*.
4. Congratulations, the plug-in is installed.

### Start previewing

After installing the plug-in, you should have a new page at `/magic/` within a few minutes. So, for example, if your blog is at https://example.com/, the address is https://example.com/magic/.

1. Go to that page.
2. Start typing and hit üîç *Preview* when you're ready.
3. The preview opens in a new tab. Detach it to a separate window and put it side-by-side with the editor to see it update as you type. Have fun!

**Pro tip:** [Split View](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948) in macOS works great with Magic Preview. The browser [Arc](https://arc.net) has a similar feature and your browser or operating system might have one as well.
