## Do you get value from Magic Preview? I'd love your support!

Hey! It's me, Sven. Magic Preview and my other plug-ins are passion projects released to the world for free. That said, donations are always welcome if you get value from my work.

[💸 Donate $10](https://dahlstrand.net/donate/) or any amount you're comfortable with. Thanks! 🙏

## Bells and whistles

* 🔍 Live previews!
* 💾 Auto-save (come back later)
* 📮 Publish (via the official Micro.blog app)

## Get started

Hello, fellow microblogger! 👋 This plug-in is available in the official directory. It's easy to install, but be aware that it's early in development. So bugs and weird things will happen. 😅

### Install the plug-in

1. Find [Magic Preview in the plug-in directory](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/89).
2. Choose the site you want to install the plug-in to.
3. Press *Install*.
4. Congratulations, the plug-in is installed.

### Start previewing

After installing the plug-in, you should have a new page at `/magic/` within a few minutes. So, for example, if your blog is at https://example.com/, the address is https://example.com/magic/.

1. Go to that page.
2. Start typing and hit 🔍 *Preview* when you're ready.
3. The preview opens in a new tab. Detach it to a separate window and put it side-by-side with the editor to see it update as you type. Have fun!

**Pro tip:** [Split View](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948) in macOS works great with Magic Preview. The browser [Arc](https://arc.net) has a similar feature and your browser or operating system might have one as well.
